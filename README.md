Comp 305 Term Project 

Summary

This is a project to maximize the score of players on a board. To do this, we brought the board as close as possible to a checkerboard format. To overcome the disadvantage of having pre-assigned spots. Firstly the most suitable checkerboard format is determined. Secondly, we filled the spots that fit predetermined checkerboard version which has no neighbours. In the end, the left available spots with 0 or 1 neighbours are filled too. The algorithm returns the possible maximum score as a result of player allignment.
